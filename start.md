# How it began

The Form.io platform was originally created in 2015, just as the web was emerging from a massive paradigm shift of web development where JavaScript was being redefined as a full-stack application framework. Before this time, web based applications were all constructed in the same way; as Server Rendered Applications. These applications leveraged monolithic technology stacks such as .NET, LAMP, Ruby on Rails, and Java, and all worked by utilizing the server to perform dynamic HTML renderings that were then sent to the client on each page request. These Server Rendered Applications were necessary since the web browser, for a long time, was not capable of executing complex dynamically rendered applications on the clients computer. This all changed, however, with the introduction of Smart Phones (starting with iPhone) where web based applications could now be rendered in the palm of your hand. Through this, web technologies quickly evolved to enable browser technologies to be capable of executing JavaScript in a very performant way. This brought about the next generation of the web, the Progressive Web.
