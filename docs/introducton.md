# Introduction
welcome to formsflow.ai

## About the Project
The project was initiated by AOT Technologies as a means of addressing the general situation whereby end-users fill in a form, the form is processed and there may be a requirement to report on the form metrics or data.

Use cases of formsflow are:

* FOI requests
* Applications for funding
* Statements of compliance
* Employee onboarding
* Performance Reviews
* Emergency processes
* Escalations
* Surveys
* Case Management
### Features

* Drag-and-drop forms-builder with rich UI components
* Lightweight server-based workflow engine with full capabilities including human, parallel, asynchronous and timed flows, decision engine, and graphical designer
* Notifications engine for notifications, reminders, and alerts on tasks and even data thresholds.
* Metrics and data visualization dashboards for the display of key workflow and form data
* Multi-tenancy isolation
* Containerized deployment with docker, docker-compose, and Openshift
* Flexible Identity Management uses existing IDM systems for authentication and single sign-on
